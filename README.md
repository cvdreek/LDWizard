# LD Wizard: Create Linked Data in One Spell

LD Wizard is a framework for creating end-user focused Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that simplify the creation and publication of linked data.

## LD Wizard Project

The LD Wizard project seeks to deliver the following products:
<dl>
  <dt>LD Wizard Interface</dt>
  <dd>The generic template that includes the technical framework and the various operational steps, without filling them in for any specific domain or use case.</dd>
  <dt>Two LD Wizard Applications</dt>
  <dd>Specific implementations of the one LD Wizard Interface.  These implementations are optimized for a specific domain or use case.</dd>
</dt>

The following LD Wizard Applications will be created:
<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/LDWizard-HelloWorld" target="_blank">“Hello, World!” Wizard</a></dt>
  <dd>Provides a minimal implementation of the LD Wizard Interface.  As such, it is a fully functional wizard that allows linked data to be created from tabular source data, and published online.  This application serves as an example for developers who want to create their own LD Wizard Application.  They can use the “Hello, World!” Wizard as a starting point.</dd>
  <dt><a href="TODO" target="_blank">Cultural Heritage Wizard</a></dt>
  <dd>Provides a wizard that can be used to create and publish simple linked datasets in the cultural heritage domain.</dd>
