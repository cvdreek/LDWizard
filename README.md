# LDWizard

A generic framework for converting common datasources to Linked Data.

# Software Requirements and Design Document (Preliminary)

## 1. Introduction
The advent of Linked Data is evident through the ever increasing activitiets within [cultural heritage](https://www.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/tag/linked-open-data/) and [social and economic history](https://stories.datalegend.net). However, for most part these initiatives still rely on expert technical knowledge regarding vocabularies and data-transformation. Confronted with the question, 'so how can we do that (Linked Data)?', when presenting the results from the 2019 Hack-a-LOD to the commmunity in a local drugstore, Erwin Folmer sparked the idea for LDWizard. A limited, but useful first gauge at transposing data to Linked Data for non-experts, yet with the ability for experts to advaance on the output by the LDWizard.

### 1.1 Purpose
To transpose a csv file in a simple yet meaningful way to Linked Data that can be expanded upon by more advanced LD converters such as RML and [CoW](https://github.com/clariah/cow/wiki).
